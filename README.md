### Hi there, I'm Wafiq <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

- 🎓 &nbsp;I am currently learning advanced software development at Mission Ready and am a recent Computer Science Graduate.
- 🔭 &nbsp;I’m always working on something new every week with Mission Ready 😄

Software development is awesome! I enjoy working on web development with technologies such as React.js and traditional HTML, CSS, JS. However, I have experience with other programming languages such as Python, C/C#, Java and am always eager to learn interesting new technologies throughout my journey to become an adept software developer 😁.
